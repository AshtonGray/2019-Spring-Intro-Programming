This project implements a basic media library system, where the user can add or remove items.
Each entry in the library contains an attribute of media (movie/book), reference #, Title, and price.
A book includes information such as the author, while a movie provides information on the director and lead actor.

MediaItem.py contains the object data
inventory.py contains all functions for the system
media-store.py contains the main program

This system is able to:
- Give the list inventory
- Info of inventory
- List of all books
- List of all movies
- Item description
- Remove an item
- Add an item
- Set maximum price
- Exit
